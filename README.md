This is simple, but very-very realistic and addictive (mwa-ha-ha) 
console game I've made after I've finished 1st chapter of Stroustrup. 
So there is you (capt'n), your ship (shiny!), klingons (boo!) and you should do something with the situation.
Grab the controls and full speed ahead!

P.S. Stroustrup. 1st chapter. You've been warned!
